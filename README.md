# Video_classification_Deployment
In this video classification project, I used a ResNet-18 model to classify between shoplifters and non-shoplifters from video footage. The trained model was saved as a .pth file and deployed using Django.  On the website, users can upload a video and it displays whether the person in the video is a shoplifter or not, along with the modelâ€™s accuracy

The trained model (r3d_video_classification_model.pth) can be downloaded from this link
